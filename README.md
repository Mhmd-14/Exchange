# Exchange
#Define a function called exchange which will accept an arguemnt which should be an integer
#The code assumes that there is list called "my_coins" which is similar to the available coins in any currency
#For example, the available coins and banknotes are 1$, 5$, 10$, 25$, 100$
#If someone gives you 166$ the code should return the best way of exchange with less banknotes or coins to be given to the user
#Thus for 166$, it should return [100,25,25,10,5,1]
